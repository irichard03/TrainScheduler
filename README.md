# TrainScheduler
Train Scheduler application, using firebase and Moment.js

Designed for mobile 640w, which after actually deploying seems to wide for my phone unless I view it in portrait mode...lesson learned.

Incorporates "Moment.js" via local minified version, the cdn I had wasn't hosted on a secure site and resulted in errors. For information about moment library please go to: https://momentjs.com/docs/, then ELI5 back to me as this was the hardest part of the assignemnt for me.

Also incorporates Firebase, this is really cool and was surprisingly easy to implment once I realized I'd left out the required javascript while we were going over it last week (copy fail <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/5.5.2/firebase.js"></script>) checkout firebase at https://console.firebase.google.com/.

Also includes boot strap https://getbootstrap.com/.
